Short outline of the project:

Fossils of micro-organisms such as planktonic foraminifera, are used widely as a proxy for past ocean conditions (). These unicellular marine 
zooplankton range from tropical to polar latitudes and are most abundant in the upper mixed layer of the ocean. During their lifespan they
form a calcium carbonate test, i.e. 'shell' around their cell. When they die, foraminifera lose their ability to stay buoyant and their
shells sink to the bottom of the ocean floor where they become part of the marine sediment. 
It is often assumed that the proxies derived from the shells represent ocean conditions above the location of deposition. However, 
foraminifera are transported by ocean currents, meaning the paleoclimatic conditions recorded from their shells may originate far from the
core site. Recent research has shown that ocean currents can generate large footprints in paleoclimatic proxies such as those of 
foraminifera. De Lange and van Sebille () have shown that foraminifera may originate up to several thousand kilometers away from the core
sites. Depending on the life traits of the species, such as life span and preferred depth habitat, the temperature offset may reach between
1.5 and 3 \degree C. At core sites located in regions with strong or shifting currents this effect of transport on the foraminifera should
be taken into careful consideration. 

The goal of this project is to quantify the influence of this transport by ocean currents on the proxy signal of foraminifera found at core
sites in the Uruguayan margin in the Argentine basin. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the proxy signal to life traits such as depth habitat,
calcification rate and sinking speed of the foraminifera will be investigated.The interplay between the transport by ocean currents and the
life traits of the foraminifera are expected to have a significant effect on the proxy signal.
